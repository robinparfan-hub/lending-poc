- Planning next week: `/sprint-week 2`
- Getting full context: `/project-context`

## Implementation Notes:
- Commands check /docs/ directory for sprint files
- Week files follow pattern: week[N]-todo.md
- Progress reports follow pattern: week[N]-progress-report.md
- Commands are idempotent and safe to run multiple times
