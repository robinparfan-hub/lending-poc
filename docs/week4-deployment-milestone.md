# Week 4: External Services Deployment - Milestone Achieved

## Date: 2025-09-04

## Summary
Successfully deployed the first external service to Render and established working integration between Salesforce and external APIs.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Service Deployment
- **Service**: credit-bureau-service
- **URL**: https://lending-poc.onrender.com
- **Status**: ✅ Live and operational
- **Endpoints Available**:
  - `/health` - Health check endpoint
  - `/api/v1/credit-check` - Full credit check with report
  - `/api/v1/credit-score` - Credit score only

### 2. Salesforce Integration
- **HttpCalloutService**: Generic HTTP callout utility class
- **Named Credential**: Credit_Bureau_Service configured
- **Authentication**: API key header (x-api-key)
- **Test Coverage**: 100% with HttpCalloutServiceTest

### 3. Integration Testing
Successfully tested end-to-end flow:
- ✅ Health check from Salesforce → Render
- ✅ Credit check API call with full response
- ✅ Credit score API call with score retrieval

### 4. Technical Architecture

```
Salesforce Org
     ↓
HttpCalloutService (Apex)
     ↓
Named Credential (Credit_Bureau_Service)
     ↓
Render Service (https://lending-poc.onrender.com)
     ↓
Mock Credit Bureau Data
```

## Key Files Created/Modified

### External Services
- `/external-services/credit-bureau-service/` - Deployed service
- `/external-services/decision-engine-service/` - Ready for deployment
- `/external-services/simple-income-service/` - Ready for deployment

### Salesforce Components
- `/force-app/main/default/classes/HttpCalloutService.cls`
- `/force-app/main/default/classes/HttpCalloutServiceTest.cls`
- `/force-app/main/default/classes/ServiceResponse.cls`
- `/force-app/main/default/namedCredentials/Credit_Bureau_Service.namedCredential-meta.xml`

## Next Steps

### Remaining Week 4 Tasks
1. Deploy decision-engine-service to Render
2. Deploy simple-income-service to Render
3. Create Named Credentials for additional services
4. Integrate all services with loan application workflow
5. Complete full end-to-end testing

### Technical Debt
- Replace hardcoded API keys with secure credential management
- Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Implement service monitoring and alerting
- Add request/response logging for debugging

## Deployment Commands Reference

### Deploy to Render
```bash
cd external-services/[service-name]
# Follow Render deployment guide
```

### Deploy to Salesforce
```bash
sf project deploy start --target-org lending-poc
```

### Test Integration
```apex
// Execute Anonymous
Boolean isHealthy = HttpCalloutService.testCreditBureauHealth();
System.debug('Health: ' + isHealthy);

ServiceResponse response = HttpCalloutService.checkCredit(
    '123-45-6789', 'John', 'Doe', '1990-01-01'
);
System.debug('Response: ' + JSON.serialize(response));
```

## Lessons Learned
1. Named Credentials are superior to Remote Site Settings for API integration
2. Mock data with deterministic hashing ensures consistent testing
3. Service health endpoints are critical for monitoring
4. Proper error handling in callout services prevents cascading failures

## Status
Week 4 is progressing well with the first successful external service deployment and integration. The foundation for microservices architecture is established and working.
