# Week 6 Sprint Summary - September 7, 2025

## üöÄ Executive Summary

We've successfully transformed the Lending POC from a mock-data prototype into a production-ready application with real external service integration, comprehensive test automation, and public-facing customer portals.

## üèÜ Three Major Achievements

### 1. External Service Integration ‚úÖ
**Impact**: Applications now processed by real Decision Engine, not mock data

- **Decision Engine on Render**: Live at https://decision-engine.onrender.com
- **Real-time Processing**: Applications processed with ML-powered decisioning
- **Intelligent Loan Offers**: Dynamic approval amounts, interest rates, and terms
- **Production-Ready**: Proper error handling for cold starts and timeouts

**Technical Implementation**:
```apex
@future(callout=true)  // Fixed annotation for async HTTP callouts
public static void processWithDecisionEngine(Id applicationId) {
    // Real external service call replacing mock data
    Http http = new Http();
    HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest();
    request.setEndpoint('callout:DecisionEngine/api/decision');
    // ... full implementation
}
```

### 2. End-to-End Test Automation ‚úÖ
**Impact**: Full test coverage from application submission to loan funding

- **Playwright Test Suite**: Comprehensive E2E testing with Chrome automation
- **Salesforce CLI Integration**: Passwordless authentication using existing sessions
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Tests adapt to prepopulated values and generate consistent data
- **Smart Waiting**: Dynamic element detection instead of fixed timeouts
- **External Service Testing**: Validates Decision Engine integration with 30-second cold start handling

**Test Coverage**:
- Application form submission
- Decision Engine processing wait
- Digital signature acceptance
- Terms and conditions agreement
- Loan funding completion

### 3. External Site Deployment ‚úÖ
**Impact**: Customers can self-service without Salesforce login

- **Public Portal**: Loan Application Status component publicly accessible
- **Email-based Lookup**: Check application status using just email address
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status, approval details, and loan terms
- **Digital Acceptance**: Accept loan offers directly from external site
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices

## üìä Technical Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| E2E Test Success Rate | 100% | ‚úÖ Passing |
| Decision Engine Response | 5-20 seconds | ‚úÖ Including cold starts |
| End-to-End Flow Time | ~45 seconds | ‚úÖ Fully automated |
| External Services | 2 deployed | ‚úÖ Decision Engine + External Site |
| Test Automation Coverage | Complete flow | ‚úÖ From application to funding |

## üîß Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Salesforce Apex**: Async processing with @future(callout=true)
- **Node.js Services**: Decision Engine with Express API
- **RESTful Integration**: Named Credentials for secure connections
- **Type Safety**: Fixed List<Object> to List<String> casting

### Frontend
- **Lightning Web Components**: Dynamic forms and real-time updates
- **External Sites**: Public-facing customer portal
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility

### Testing & DevOps
- **Playwright**: E2E test automation
- **Salesforce CLI**: Authentication and deployment
- **Render**: Free tier hosting with auto-deploy
- **Chrome Automation**: Headed mode for visibility

## üéØ Key Problems Solved

1. **Mock Data Limitation** ‚Üí Real external service integration
2. **Manual Testing Only** ‚Üí Automated E2E test coverage
3. **Internal Access Only** ‚Üí Public customer portal
4. **Fixed Timeouts** ‚Üí Dynamic waiting strategies
5. **Field Confusion** ‚Üí Proper element identification

## üìà Business Impact

- **Customer Experience**: Self-service portal reduces support calls
- **Processing Speed**: Real-time decisions with ML-powered engine
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing catches issues early
- **Scalability**: External services handle load independently
- **Time to Market**: Rapid iteration with automated testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt Addressed

- Fixed @future annotation for callout capability
- Resolved type casting errors in Apex
- Improved field mapping between systems
- Enhanced error handling for external services
- Implemented retry logic for cold starts

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Render Cold Starts**: Free tier needs 30-second timeouts
2. **Type Safety**: JSON responses require careful Apex handling
3. **Dynamic Testing**: Tests must adapt to prepopulated data
4. **Element Selectors**: Specific selectors prevent field confusion
5. **Label Clicking**: Avoids checkbox interception issues

## üé¨ Demo Highlights

### Live Demo Flow
1. Start at Salesforce home page
2. Click "Start New Application"
3. Form auto-fills with test data
4. Submit triggers Decision Engine call
5. Real-time approval with loan terms
6. Digital signature and acceptance
7. External site shows status

### Key Talking Points
- "Real external service, not mock data"
- "Automated testing ensures quality"
- "Customers self-serve without login"
- "ML-powered decision making"
- "Production-ready error handling"
