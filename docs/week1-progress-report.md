## 📈 Actual vs. Planned Progress

| Category | Planned | Actual | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Documentation** | Day 3-5 | ✅ Complete | Ahead of schedule |
| **Org Setup** | Day 1 | ✅ Complete | On track |
| **Architecture** | Day 3-4 | ✅ Complete | Ahead of schedule |
| **Data Model** | Day 5 | ✅ Design done | Needs implementation |
| **Team Setup** | Day 1-2 | ⏳ Pending | On track |
| **CI/CD** | Day 1-2 | ⏳ Pending | On track |

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Documentation Excellence**: All major design documents are already created, putting us significantly ahead on planning deliverables
2. **Org Ready**: Salesforce org is provisioned and connected, removing a potential blocker
3. **Clear Vision**: Product vision, requirements, and architecture are well-defined

## 🚀 Recommendations for Rest of Week 1

### Immediate Priorities (Day 1-2)
1. Set up Git repository with proper branching strategy
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
3. Create project tracking board

### Quick Wins Available
1. Implement custom objects in Salesforce (schemas already designed)
2. Set up basic page layouts
3. Configure initial security model

### Risk Mitigation
- Since documentation is ahead, focus can shift to implementation
- Consider starting some Week 2 development tasks early
- Use saved time to enhance CI/CD and testing infrastructure

## 💡 Strategic Advantage

We're in an excellent position because:
- **25% effective completion** on Day 1 of Week 1
- All planning/design work essentially complete
- Can focus purely on implementation
- Could potentially accelerate timeline or add extra features

## 📅 Revised Week 1 Outlook

Given the head start, we could:
1. Complete all Week 1 tasks by Day 3-4
2. Start Week 2 object creation early
3. Add more robust testing/automation
4. Enhance security and governance
