## 📊 Technical Achievements

### Critical Bug Fixes Completed
```apex
// Fixed type casting error in LoanApplicationController.cls
Map<String, Object> convertedMap = new Map<String, Object>();
for (Object key : incomeData.keySet()) {
    convertedMap.put(String.valueOf(key), incomeData.get(key));
}

// Added missing field to form validation
<lightning-input 
    name="dateOfBirth" 
    label="Date of Birth" 
    type="date" 
    value={formData.dateOfBirth}
    onchange={handleInputChange} 
    required>
</lightning-input>
```

### Component Architecture Improvements
- **Parent-Child Data Flow**: Fixed loanApplicationWizard → loanOfferAcceptance communication
- **State Management**: Added sessionStorage persistence for form context
- **Event Handling**: Proper custom event dispatching for progress tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of validation and API errors

### ML Services Enhanced

#### Decision Engine Service
```javascript
// Logistic Regression Scoring Model
const riskScore = sigmoid(
    0.15 * creditScore +
    0.20 * incomeStability +
    0.15 * dtiRatio +
    0.10 * employmentLength +
    0.10 * loanAmount +
    0.15 * collateralValue +
    0.15 * existingDebt
);
```

#### Income Verification Service
```javascript
// Z-Score Anomaly Detection
const zScore = Math.abs((income - meanIncome) / stdDevIncome);
const anomalyDetected = zScore > 2.5;
const stabilityScore = calculateStabilityScore(incomeHistory);
```
