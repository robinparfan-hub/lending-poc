# Week 4: External Services Integration - COMPLETED ✅

## Date: 2025-09-04
## Status: Successfully Completed All Week 4 Objectives

---

## 🎯 Week 4 Objectives Achieved

### ✅ 1. External Services Development
Created three microservices with Express.js matching Apex mock data patterns:
- **credit-bureau-service**: Credit checks and score retrieval
- **decision-engine-service**: Loan approval decision logic
- **simple-income-service**: Income verification and DTI calculations

### ✅ 2. Cloud Deployment
Successfully deployed all services to Render cloud platform:
- **Credit Bureau**: https://lending-poc.onrender.com
- **Decision Engine**: https://decision-engine-l55w.onrender.com
- **Income Service**: https://income-verification.onrender.com

### ✅ 3. Salesforce Integration
- Created generic `HttpCalloutService` class for external API calls
- Implemented `ServiceResponse` wrapper for consistent response handling
- Configured Named Credentials for secure API connections
- Added comprehensive test coverage with `HttpCalloutServiceTest`

### ✅ 4. End-to-End Testing
- Verified all services are accessible from Salesforce
- Tested health endpoints for service monitoring
- Confirmed data consistency between Apex mocks and external services
- Successfully executed callouts using Named Credentials

  - Loan evaluation endpoint
  - 8 decision scenarios matching Apex
  - Risk assessment logic
  
- `/external-services/simple-income-service/`
  - Income verification endpoint
  - DTI calculation endpoint
  - 4 income profiles

#### Salesforce Components
- `/force-app/main/default/classes/`
  - `HttpCalloutService.cls` - Generic HTTP utility
  - `ServiceResponse.cls` - Response wrapper
  - `HttpCalloutServiceTest.cls` - 100% test coverage
  
- `/force-app/main/default/namedCredentials/`
  - `Credit_Bureau_Service.namedCredential-meta.xml`
  - `Decision_Engine_Service.namedCredential-meta.xml`
  - `Income_Service.namedCredential-meta.xml`

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Named Credentials > Remote Site Settings**
   - More secure and maintainable
   - Built-in authentication support
   - Easier endpoint management

2. **Deterministic Mock Data**
   - Using hash-based scenario selection ensures consistency
   - Same applicationId always returns same results
   - Facilitates reliable testing

3. **Render Free Tier Considerations**
   - Services sleep after 15 minutes inactivity
   - Auto-wake on request (30-60 second delay)
   - Limited to 3 free web services per account

4. **Service Health Endpoints**
   - Critical for monitoring service availability
   - Quick way to verify deployment success
   - Useful for debugging connectivity issues

## 🚀 Next Steps (Post Week 4)

### Immediate Tasks
1. Wire up services to actual loan application workflow
2. Add error handling and retry logic
3. Implement request/response logging
4. Create service monitoring dashboard

### Future Enhancements
1. Add authentication beyond API keys
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add caching for frequently accessed data
4. Create webhook endpoints for async processing
5. Implement circuit breaker pattern
