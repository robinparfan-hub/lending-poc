# Income Verification Service Policy & Statistical Analysis Model Documentation
**Version 1.0 | Last Updated: September 6, 2025**

## Executive Summary

The Income Verification Service employs advanced statistical analysis methods and z-score anomaly detection to verify income authenticity and stability. This document explains how the service analyzes income patterns, detects potential fraud, and calculates stability scores to support lending decisions.

## Statistical Analysis Model

### Primary Algorithm: Z-Score Anomaly Detection v1.0
- **Method**: Statistical pattern analysis with anomaly detection
- **Purpose**: Income verification and fraud detection
- **Core Technique**: Z-score calculation for outlier identification
- **Output**: Stability score (0-100), verification confidence level, anomaly flags

### Key Metrics Calculated
1. **Income Stability Score** (0-100 scale)
2. **Verification Confidence** (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. **Anomaly Detection** (spikes, drops, patterns)
4. **Fraud Risk Indicators** (behavioral patterns)

---

## Core Statistical Calculations

### Statistical Measures

| Metric | Formula | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Mean Income** | Σ(incomes) ÷ n | Central tendency baseline |
| **Median Income** | Middle value when sorted | Robust central measure |
| **Standard Deviation** | √(Σ(income - mean)² ÷ n) | Income variability measure |
| **Coefficient of Variation** | std_dev ÷ mean | Normalized variability |
| **Linear Trend** | Simple regression slope | Income growth/decline pattern |

### Z-Score Anomaly Detection
```
Z-Score = (individual_income - mean_income) ÷ standard_deviation

Anomaly Thresholds:
- Normal Range: |Z-Score| ≤ 2.5
- Medium Anomaly: 2.5 < |Z-Score| ≤ 3.5  
- High Anomaly: |Z-Score| > 3.5
```

---

## Income Stability Score Calculation

The stability score combines multiple factors with weighted importance:

### Stability Factors & Weights

| Factor | Weight | Calculation | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Consistency** | 40% | 100 - (CoV × 100) | Lower variation = higher score |
| **Trend Stability** | 20% | Based on growth pattern | Positive growth preferred |
| **Anomaly Penalty** | 30% | 100 - (anomaly_count × 15) | Fewer anomalies = higher score |
| **Employment Bonus** | 10% | min(20, employment_months ÷ 6 × 20) | Longer employment = bonus points |

### Final Score Formula
```
Stability Score = (Consistency × 0.4) + (Trend × 0.2) + 
                 (Anomaly_Penalty × 0.3) + (Employment_Bonus × 0.1)
```

## Anomaly Detection System

### Anomaly Categories

#### 1. Income Spikes (Z-Score > 2.5)
- **Definition**: Monthly income significantly above normal
- **Typical Causes**: Bonuses, overtime, one-time payments
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium - may indicate irregular income
- **Example**: $8,000 income in month when average is $5,000

#### 2. Income Drops (Z-Score < -2.5)  
- **Definition**: Monthly income significantly below normal
- **Typical Causes**: Reduced hours, unpaid leave, job changes
- **Risk Assessment**: High - indicates income instability
- **Example**: $2,000 income in month when average is $5,000

#### 3. Pattern Anomalies
- **Round Number Bias**: >70% of incomes are round thousands
- **Irregular Deposits**: Deposit frequency varies dramatically
- **Sudden Changes**: Recent 3-month average >2x historical average

---

## Fraud Detection Algorithms

### Primary Fraud Indicators

#### 1. Sudden Income Increase (HIGH Severity)
```
Trigger Condition: 
recent_3_month_average > historical_average × 2

Risk Level: HIGH
Description: "Recent income more than doubled compared to history"
```

#### 2. Round Number Fabrication (MEDIUM Severity)  
```
Trigger Condition:
round_number_count > total_months × 0.7

Risk Level: MEDIUM  
Description: "Suspicious pattern of round numbers in income"
```

#### 3. Irregular Deposit Patterns (MEDIUM Severity)
```
Trigger Condition:
irregular_deposits > total_months × 0.3

Risk Level: MEDIUM
Description: "Inconsistent deposit patterns detected"
```

### Fraud Risk Matrix
| Indicator Count | Severity | Verification Confidence |
|----------------|----------|-------------------------|
| 0 indicators | None | HIGH |
| 1-2 Medium indicators | Low | MEDIUM |
| 3+ Medium indicators | Medium | LOW |
| 1+ High indicators | High | LOW |

---

## Verification Confidence Levels

- **Typical Profile**: Regular employment, consistent deposits, minimal variation
- **Action**: Proceed with loan processing

#### REVIEW (Stability Score 50-69)
- **Income Pattern**: Moderately stable with some concerns
- **Risk Level**: Medium  
- **Typical Profile**: Some income variation, occasional anomalies, employment gaps
- **Action**: Additional verification required

#### CAUTION (Stability Score < 50)
- **Income Pattern**: Unstable or concerning
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Typical Profile**: High variation, multiple anomalies, fraud indicators
- **Action**: Comprehensive manual review or decline

## DTI (Debt-to-Income) Analysis

### DTI Calculation
```
DTI Ratio = (Total Monthly Debts ÷ Monthly Income) × 100
```

### DTI Classifications
| DTI Range | Classification | Risk Level | Lending Impact |
|-----------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| 0-36% | Excellent | Low | Premium rates available |
| 37-43% | Good | Medium | Standard rates |
| 44-50% | Fair | Medium-High | Rate premium, conditions |
| >50% | Poor | High | Typically declined |

### Maximum Loan Payment Calculation
Based on the 28% housing rule:
```
Max Monthly Payment = (Monthly Income × 0.28) - Existing Mortgage Payment
```

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

### "Why did we get a low stability score for a regular employee?"
Check these factors:
1. **Income variation**: Even small variations can impact scores
2. **Anomaly detection**: Bonuses or overtime may trigger anomaly flags
3. **Employment duration**: Newer employees get lower bonus points
4. **Data quality**: Ensure complete 12-month income history

### "What causes LOW verification confidence?"
Primary triggers:
1. Multiple HIGH-severity fraud indicators
2. Stability score below 30
3. 3+ significant income anomalies
4. Suspicious round number patterns

### "How do we handle seasonal income workers?"
- Higher coefficient of variation expected
- Look for seasonal patterns vs. random variation
- Focus on annual income consistency
- Consider employment history bonus factor

---

## Data Requirements

### Minimum Data Requirements
- **Income History**: Minimum 3 months, optimal 12 months
- **Deposit Patterns**: Monthly deposit frequency (optional but recommended)
- **Employment Info**: Start date, employer, position
- **Bank Account Data**: For deposit pattern analysis

### Data Quality Standards
- Income amounts must be numeric and positive
- Dates must be in chronological order
- Missing months should be clearly identified
- Employment gaps should be documented
