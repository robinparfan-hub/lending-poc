## Common User Questions & Explanations

### For Internal Users & Agentforce

#### "Why was this application approved/denied?"

**For Approvals**:
1. Check the approval probability from Decision Engine
2. Review income stability score and confidence level
3. Examine credit score impact (highest weight factor)
4. Verify DTI ratio compliance (<43%)
5. Consider employment stability bonus

**For Denials**:
1. Identify the primary risk factors:
   - Credit score below thresholds
   - DTI ratio exceeding 45-50%
   - Income instability or fraud indicators
   - Employment concerns
2. Review specific reason codes provided
3. Check if fraud indicators triggered manual review

#### "Why did the rate come out higher than expected?"

**Rate Calculation Formula**:
```
Final Rate = Base Rate (5.5%) + Risk Premium

Risk Premium = (1 - Approval_Probability) × 15%

Example: 65% approval probability
Risk Premium = (1 - 0.65) × 15% = 5.25%
Final Rate = 5.5% + 5.25% = 10.75%
```

#### "What does this stability score mean?"

**Income Stability Scores**:
- **90-100**: Extremely stable, regular employment income
- **80-89**: Very stable, minor variations expected
- **70-79**: Generally stable, some seasonal variation
- **60-69**: Moderately stable, notable income variations
- **50-59**: Concerning instability, requires verification
- **Below 50**: High risk, likely decline or extensive review

#### "How do we interpret fraud indicators?"

**Fraud Risk Levels**:
- **HIGH Severity**: Immediate manual review required
  - Sudden income doubling
  - Fabricated employment claims
- **MEDIUM Severity**: Additional verification needed
  - Round number patterns in income
  - Irregular deposit patterns
- **Action Required**: All HIGH indicators trigger manual review
