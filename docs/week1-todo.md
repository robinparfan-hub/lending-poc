## 📋 Todo List

### Day 1-2: Project Setup & Planning

#### Environment Setup
- [x] ✅ Create Salesforce Developer org (COMPLETED - org: lending-poc)
  - Org ID: 00DgK00000A9SVcUAN

- [x] ✅ Install VS Code with Salesforce extensions (COMPLETED)
- [x] ✅ Configure Git repository and branch strategy (COMPLETED)
  - Repository: https://github.com/robinparfan-hub/lending-poc
- [→] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions/Jenkins) → MOVED TO WEEK 2
- [→] Create project board in Jira/Asana → Using local & Notion todos instead
- [→] Configure additional development sandboxes (if needed) → MOVED TO WEEK 2

#### Team Alignment
- [→] Team alignment activities → MOVED TO WEEK 2 (when code work begins)

### Day 3-4: Architecture & Design

#### Technical Architecture
- [ ] Create system architecture diagram
- [ ] Define integration patterns (REST, Event-driven, Batch)
- [ ] Design security model (Authentication, Authorization, Encryption)
- [ ] Document performance requirements (SLAs, Response times)
- [✓] Data retention policies → Covered in architecture doc
- [—] Disaster recovery plan → SKIPPED (not needed for POC)

#### API Design
- [ ] Design RESTful API specifications
- [ ] Define webhook event catalog
- [ ] Create authentication/authorization strategy
- [✓] Rate limiting rules → Defined in API design doc
- [✓] API documentation structure → Completed in api-design.md
- [✓] Error handling patterns → Defined in API design doc

### Day 5: Data Model & Integrations

#### Data Model Implementation
- [ ] Create Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
- [ ] Define custom objects schema:
  - [ ] Loan_Application__c
  - [ ] Applicant_Profile__c
  - [ ] Income_Source__c
  - [ ] Verification__c
  - [ ] Credit_Report__c
  - [ ] Decision__c
  - [ ] Loan__c
  - [ ] Payment__c
  - [ ] Document__c
- [ ] Plan relationships and lookups
- [ ] Design validation rules and formulas
- [ ] Create sharing model and OWD settings

#### Integration Planning
- [ ] Design Plaid integration architecture
- [ ] Plan credit bureau connector (Experian/Equifax/TransUnion)
- [ ] Design identity verification flow (IDV)
- [ ] Create document processing pipeline architecture
- [ ] Plan payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal)
- [ ] Define integration error handling and retry logic

## 📊 Success Metrics
- [ ] All design documents reviewed and approved
- [ ] Development environment fully operational
- [ ] Team onboarded with access to all tools
- [ ] Architecture review completed with stakeholders
- [ ] Data model documented and validated

## 🚧 Known Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Salesforce org provisioning delay | High | Request org early, have backup developer edition |
| Team availability | Medium | Identify backup resources, document decisions |
| Requirement changes | Medium | Lock requirements for Week 1, defer changes |
| Tool access issues | Low | Pre-verify all access, have admin support ready |

## 📝 Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] Architecture design document (PDF)
- [ ] API specification document (OpenAPI format)
- [ ] Data model ERD diagram
- [ ] Integration sequence diagrams
- [ ] Security model documentation
- [ ] Project wiki/confluence space setup
- [ ] Development environment setup guide
- [ ] Week 1 demo presentation deck

## 🎯 Definition of Done
