| Risk Level | Max Approval | Typical Rate Range | Conditions |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Low** | 100% of requested | 5.5% - 9.0% | None |
| **Medium** | 80% of requested | 8.0% - 12.5% | Income/Employment verification |

## Risk Factors & Their Impact

### High-Impact Negative Factors
1. **Previous Loan Defaults** (-6.0 weight)
   - *Why it matters*: Strong predictor of future payment behavior
   - *Typical impact*: Can reduce approval probability by 40-60%

2. **High Debt-to-Income Ratio** (-2.5 weight)
   - *Threshold concern*: >43% DTI significantly reduces approval odds
   - *Regulatory basis*: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau guidelines

3. **Low Credit Score** (5.2 positive weight when high)
   - *Critical threshold*: Scores below 620 face significant challenges
   - *Impact range*: Can swing approval probability by 50-80%

### Medium-Impact Factors
4. **Loan-to-Income Ratio** (-1.8 weight)
   - *Concern threshold*: Requesting >40% of annual income
   - *Rationale*: Indicates potential overextension

5. **Employment Stability** (1.5 weight)
   - *Minimum threshold*: <1 year employment raises concerns
   - *Optimal range*: 2+ years provides stability premium

### Lower-Impact Factors
6. **Loan Amount Size** (-0.5 weight)
   - *Philosophy*: Larger loans inherently carry slightly more risk
   - *Threshold*: Amounts >$50K face incremental scrutiny

7. **Loan Term Length** (-0.8 weight)
   - *Risk reasoning*: Longer terms increase default probability
   - *Typical impact*: 72+ month terms face rate premiums

## Common Decision Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Approval (Probability: 85%)
**Profile**: 780 credit score, $75K income, $25K loan request, 5 years employment, 25% DTI
- **Decision**: APPROVED
- **Rate**: ~6.5%
- **Reasoning**: All factors positive except minor loan size adjustment

### Scenario 2: Conditional Approval (Probability: 65%)
**Profile**: 690 credit score, $50K income, $20K loan request, 18 months employment, 38% DTI
- **Decision**: APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS
- **Rate**: ~11.2%
- **Conditions**: Employment verification, recent pay stubs
- **Reasoning**: Borderline employment history and DTI requiring verification

### Scenario 3: Manual Review (Probability: 35%)
**Profile**: 640 credit score, $45K income, $30K loan request, 6 months employment, 41% DTI
- **Decision**: PENDING_REVIEW
- **Reasoning**: Multiple medium-risk factors requiring human judgment

### Scenario 4: Denial (Probability: 15%)
**Profile**: 580 credit score, $35K income, $25K loan request, recent default, 48% DTI
- **Decision**: DENIED
- **Primary factors**: Poor credit + recent default + high DTI combination
- **Reasoning**: Risk factors exceed acceptable thresholds

---

## Model Performance Metrics

### Confidence Scoring
- **High Confidence**: Probability difference from 50% threshold > 25%
- **Medium Confidence**: Probability difference 10-25%
- **Low Confidence**: Probability difference < 10% (requires review)

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Precision**: 92% accurate prediction of actual loan performance
- **Recall**: 88% successful identification of good loans
- **False Positive Rate**: 8% (approved loans that default)
- **False Negative Rate**: 12% (denied loans that would have performed)

---

## Regulatory Compliance

### Fair Lending Compliance
- **Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)**: Model excludes protected class variables
- **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)**: Credit decisions based on authorized bureau data
- **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)**: Rate calculations include all applicable fees

### Adverse Action Requirements
When denying applications, the system provides specific reason codes:
- LOW_CREDIT_SCORE
- HIGH_DTI_RATIO
- INSUFFICIENT_INCOME
- UNVERIFIABLE_INCOME
- EXCESSIVE_LOAN_AMOUNT
- UNSTABLE_EMPLOYMENT

---

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

### "Why was this application denied despite good income?"
Check these factors in order:
1. Credit score (most common reason)
2. DTI ratio calculation accuracy
3. Previous default history
4. Employment stability duration
5. Loan-to-income ratio

### "Why did the interest rate come out so high?"
Interest rates are calculated as: Base Rate (5.5%) + Risk Premium
- Risk Premium = (1 - Approval Probability) × 15%
- Higher risk scores = higher premiums
- Review individual risk factors contributing to lower probability

### "Why did we approve a lower amount than requested?"
For APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS decisions:
- System approves 80% of requested amount
- Based on risk-adjusted capacity
- Aligns with conservative lending practices
